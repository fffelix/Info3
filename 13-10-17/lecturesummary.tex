\Huge\textbf{Lecture Summary}

\doublespacing
\normalsize

In this lecture we were introduced to software configuration management, it's features and advantages. First examples using centralized version control showed how basics checkins, diffs, branching and merging are done. Basic terms and actions of SCM were explained.

We then did some groupwork (in teams of two), where we had to choose a repo from gtihub.com/trending and look at its commit history, network graph, branches, tags and the blame button. Github or git in general beeing decentralized scm systems, we were introduced to the core concepts of dcvs, its new commands as well as its advantages. The course ended with a demonstration of git, creating a new repo, adding files, commiting them, branching, cloning and merging them.
